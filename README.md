# user-service

**This is a playground repo, and in middle of devlopment, so didn't have completely functionality yet**

This is a simple service, aim to offer a simple authencation functionality.

Just write it for fun and practice haskell coding skill,

and familar with pure functional programming with real world case.

## TODO list

list a todo list to prevent myself from lost in lots of unfamilar and intersting things...

- [X] auth: need to use Servent Context with Servant.Auth package. 
- [X] log: create a formal log format.
- [X] refactor code folder. add common module.
- [X] refactor code, use qulified import if possible, import seems to mess to me.
- [X] finish login
- [X] a web guard by auth (this although implement in servant, just use it..)
- [X] finish register
